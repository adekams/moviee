## Hello! :wave:

Welcome to my webpage.


[Moviee](https://moviee-page.netlify.app) is a project created using the [TMdb's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [axios](https://www.github,com/axios/axios) to make a movie web page. Each movie is embedded in a card and each movie card consists of the information about the movie which includes an image, the movie title, and a brief description about the movie.

Use this webpage to check for popular and trending movies.

Movies can be searched for by entering particular keywords in the search input field provided at the top right corner on desktop or below the logo on mobile.
